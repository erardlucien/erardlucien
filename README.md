### Hi, my name is Lucien Erard
I am currently learning Java, Rust, python, Oracle SQL, Dart, Scala, sqlite3, C#, Zig. I have some experience with C, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am also learning frameworks (Vue.js, Flet, React.js, tauri) and libaries(matplotlib, numpy, sympy, scipy). I am interested in Hardware programming and Software programming. I am also planning to learn how to program a AI-System.
I can work in team and also independently.
I always take my work seriously. I read a read lot about programming and also exercise myself about it.
I like to have a deep understanding of which language ich use. I have nothing against failures, because it help me to improve my skills and have a deep understanding of what i learn. I regularly take some pause, so that i am not overdoing.
If i catch your interest, feel free to contact me at: lucienerard@proton.me.
I will gladly respond to others questions you may have.
